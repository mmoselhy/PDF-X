Headergen
---------
 Program to automatically update .h files from .cc file
 On execution will parse all .cc files in current directory and generate
 or refresh all .h files if needed.
 You can put list of files (ore file or regexp per line) in file .headergen.ignore in
 directory with files. These files will be ignored.
 Any functions from .cc file not present in header file will be added to header, rest
 of header is unmodified
 Program will also add include guards
 (#ifdef __FILENAME_H__ ... ) if not present in header
 Current limitations:
 -  return type of function must be on same line as name of function
 -  File must conform to coding rules (name of class included in file must be equal
    to name of file, except case of letters)

 Default parameter in constructors:
 These cannot be in .c files, so it is parsed from comments:
  Class::Class(int param /*=default_value*/,int param2 .... in .c file
   to
  Class::Class(int param=default_value,int param2 .... in .h file
