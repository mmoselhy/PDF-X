		<title>Selecting text</title>

		<para>
				This mode is useful when selecting text on page. It behaves like expected from
				text selecting. Word and line order is respected on pages with
				horizontal text lines (most of pdf files).
		</para>
		<para>
				Text selection is very simple using this mode. The selection starts when
				mouse left button is pressed on a text element. (If the mouse is over a text element
				the cursor changes to ibeam.) When dragging, text is
				selected line by line. The selection is limited in how the text elements are stored in
				the pdf document (some documents have text elements equal to letters, to words,
				to lines or arbitrary).
		</para>
		<para>
			Note:
				When a text on one line is written using different fonts it is very likely that it will
				be parsed into more lines. This is due to the fact that the base vertical positions are different
				and without wild guessing it is almost impossible to distinguish between text on one with different
				fonts and text on more lines with different fonts.
