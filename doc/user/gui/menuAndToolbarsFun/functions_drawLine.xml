				Drawing lines is easy with this mode. First set default properties in the toolbar:
				<xref linkend="gui_toolbars_foregroundColor"/>, <xref linkend="gui_toolbars_lineWidth"/>
				and <xref linkend="gui_menu_dashStyle"/>. Then by pressing the mouse left button and dragging a line
				is created. After releasing mouse button the line is drawn.
				The line drawn during dragging is only informative. 
				The viewed part of the page is updated after each added line.
