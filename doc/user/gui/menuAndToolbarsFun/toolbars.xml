		Toolbars are shortcut for functions found either in menu, or by right clicking on specific objects.
		Menu items can be either in enabled or disabled state. Some operations have no effect when a document
		is not open so they are disabled. Also some operations are not avaliable when specific objects from specific
		windows are not selected.
