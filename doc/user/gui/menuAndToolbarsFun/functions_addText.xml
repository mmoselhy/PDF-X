		<title>Adding text</title>

		<para>
				This mode enables adding text lines onto the page. First set some default properties on the toolbar like
				<xref linkend="gui_toolbars_foregroundColor"/>, <xref linkend="gui_toolbars_font"/>
				and <xref linkend="gui_toolbars_fontSize"/>. Then by clicking mouse left button on page an edit box is shown
				where the added text is written. After pressing Enter the text will be displayed on the page.
				The viewed part of the page is updated after text addition.
		</para>
		<para>
				The text is added to the page also if the text edit line losts focus (this can be unpleasant for
				window managers that set focus to windows under the mouse cursor).
				To cancel text addition press <emphasis>Esc</emphasis> key.
		</para>
		<para>
				Note: When pages are rotated the text can appear unrotated. This is because the text uses own transformation
				matrix than the whole page.
