		<para>
				This mode displayes and enables selecting of annotations on a page.
				When activated each annotation is displayed as a rectangle (shows
				activation rectangle for each of annotations). It's very useful
				because user can see all the annotations on a page and does not need
				to search for (annotations can be hidden). Only very few viewers support
				this feature.
		</para>
		<para>
				An annotations is selected when the mouse cursor is over.
				It is selected until the mouse cursor get over another annotation or 
				till <emphasis>Esc</emphasis> key is not pressed.
