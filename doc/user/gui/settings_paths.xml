	You can set paths to various files here. The path is semicolon-separated list of directories,
	each of them can contain environment variablesm, which will be automatically expanded,
	such as <envar>$HOME</envar> (which will
	expand to user's home directory) or <envar>$LANG</envar> (which can expand to name of selected locale)	
	There are also two special variables, <envar>$PDFEDIT_DATA</envar> will expand to directory with
	editor datafiles (<filename>/usr/local/share/pdfedit</filename> by default) and <envar>$PDFEDIT_BIN</envar>
