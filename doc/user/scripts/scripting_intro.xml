   PDFEditor have support for scripting. Evey item in menu (or toolbar) runs a script
   (mostly just short call of function, but using complex scripts from menu
   is possible), and also user can type script commands directly into
   commandline. Every invocation of script from menu will echo the command
   to the commandline, so user can learn how to do things in menu directly
   from commandline if he wants.

   QSA is used for scripting, which is based on ECMAScript standard
   (if you don't know what ECMAScript is, it is basically the same
    syntax as JavaScript)

   This documentation will not explain the language syntax, but will document
   all functions and objects that are exported from the application to the
   scripting engine so they may be used in scripts and menus.
   Also how the scripting work in general and how it can be configured will be explained.

   <note>Scripts are not "secure" by design, as the API contain functions to read or write
   arbitrary files and directories and to execute external processes.
   See http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1.5/extensions-2.html for description
   of File, Dir and Process classes, which are available to script.</note>
