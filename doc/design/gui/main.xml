   This part describes some basic principles of graphical user interface.
   Described is menu settings system, used to manage menu and toolbar items, 
   setting system, which is used to read, write, manage and watch settings
   and defaults and the tree system, which is used to manage the object
   treeview on right side of editor window.
   Some of the principles (settings system) work also in commandline interface,
   although there is one small difference - in comandline mode there is no
   system to notify about changed setting, but it is also not necessary,
   as there is no user interaction in that mode.
