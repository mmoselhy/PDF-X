Differences of included build against stock QSA 1.1.5:

* Removed examples, documentation and similar unnecessary stuff
* Renamed library from qsa to qsa_pdfedit to avoid collisions
* Modified the build process to allow using different qmake
  (on some systems using "qmake" will invoke Qt4 qmake, while
  Qt3 qmake is under different name and/or path)
* Removed mention of commercial license - since this instance
  of QSA is inserted into GPL'ed project, it's now GPL only.
* Fixed "make distclean" not cleaning everything it should.
* Unfortunately, one of the bugfixes in QSA 1.1.5 caused
  scripting in pdfedit to became nonfunctional.
  File quickobjects.cpp was partially reverted to state in 1.1.4
  (removed some isNaN tests caused by improperly fixed bug.
  This reintroduces the bug, but the bug is minor,
  as it affect only badly written scripts and does not result
  in crash :)
