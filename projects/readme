Win32 pdfedit* release
---------------------------
The main purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the underlying pdfedit library. Currently, there are several tools which can be used from command line and a proof of concept for win32 GUI. 

Pdfedit Win32 release is beta. It also means that all executables are compiled in debug mode and therefore are slower and bigger; however, the functionality is the same.  

We use Visual Studio 2008 for building and CRT is statically linked. This means that no dll hell/incorrect runtime environment problems occur but there is significant file size overhead.

Problems
---------------------------
Please, feel free to report any problems on pdfedit-support@lists.sourceforge.net or visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfedit/ for more information.


Step-by-step instructions on how to compile pdfedit on clean PC  
---------------------------

== pdfedit ==
1. download the sources (already done when you read this)

== VS 2008 ==
2. download and install VS 2008! C++ Express Edition
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/ 

== boost ==
3. install boost
http://www.boostpro.com/download/
- select 2008 compiler
- select optional packages - programoptions  should be enough
3.1 open VS Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories and add boost directory to 
Include files: (e.g. c:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_44\)
Library files: (e.g. c:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_44\lib\)
4. try to build test_boost 
if NOT  OK go to #3 and try again?
if OK continue

== zlib ==
5. download e.g. zlib-1.2.5. sources and unpack it somewhere and
http://www.zlib.net/
5.1 open VS Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories and add boost directory to 
Include files: (e.g. g:\private\work\projects\pdfedit\zlib\zlib-1.2.3\)
6. build test_zlib
if NOT  OK go to #5 and try again?
if OK continue

==freetype==
7. download freetype and unpack it somewhere
https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.3.12/ft2312.zip/download
7.1 open VS Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories and add boost directory to 
Include files: (e.g. g:\private\work\projects\pdfedit\freetype\include\)
8. build test_freetype2
if NOT  OK go to #5 and try again?
if OK continue

==libpng==
8. download png and create libraries libpng/libpngd
the same process as above

Select Platform/Configuration Debug-Win32 / Win32 and build it

Troubleshooting
---------------------------

  1) problems with zlib/freetype:
  
  sol #1) if you want to compile it against library versions of zlib/freetype you have to use the same Runtime libraries (MT, MTd, ...). If you changed it you have to change it everywhere.
  
  sol #2) try to build those yourselves
  
  2) problems with gui.installer
  download python, 7z and add it to PATH
